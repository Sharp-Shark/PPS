This Primitive Particle System (PPS), along with graphMaker and saveMaker were made by Sharp-Shark!
Primitive Particle System aka Particle Life.

I was inspired by :

	And [More Stuff about Particle Life]

Thanks for the people over at Dani's Basement for helping with some of the math, it wouldn't have been possible to make this mediocre project.

// More Info //
I recommend getting PyPy to boost the Speed of the Simulation.
Use "graphMaker.py" to Visualize a Particle's Relations.
Use "saveMaker.py" to Create a Empty-ish Save File.
Use "PPS.py" to Run your Save Files.
If you used the standart format on your Save Files, you can just run them, like any Python File.
If you're confident, you can change PPS directly.
